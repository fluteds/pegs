# Phil's Early Gang Society

Also known as "Pegs!" Here you will find some useful resources for offline/online chat and useful tools that can improve your Twitch experience.

If you have any questions or want something taken off (or put on) DM me on Twitter `@fluted_` or whisper me on Twitch `@fluted`. If you have a hand in using GitHub or know how to do pull requests, this site is fully open sourced!

## VODS

Looking to catch up on past streams?

- `!vods` - Chat command that sends a link to our vod sheet! Made by Skyler.
- [VOD Sheet](https://tinyurl.com/PhilzaVODList) - Community ran Google Doc that contains links, timestamps and summaries on past VODs. You can submit your own timestamps and summaries to be reviewed [here!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSch_ZV5-J9eYte62ONz01R1pB9aWi8auAQ37YjRjyVIh0fzGg/viewform)
- [Unofficial VODs **YouTube channel** run by Mercy.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbbFwA30EUO2p2U1RCnwVTA)

## Chatterino

Want to chat more offline and online? Most of us use a handy chat client called **Chatterino** to chat with fellow Pegs online and offline. Note: You cannot gain points while watching a stream just in Chatterino/Streamlink you must have the Twitch chat in a browser open.

### Features

- Custom pings
- Chat highlights
- Chat filters, such as local sub mode

### Setting Up Chatterino

Chatterino can be very overwhelming to use when you first download it. Skyler made a [very useful and helpful Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/155OY6ndhY3Iy_4xo9Nf6fkRFgsWBrjjgqHGip4Vf4D0/edit) explaining all the main features of Chatterino and how to set it up to how you want it.

Link to the guide can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/155OY6ndhY3Iy_4xo9Nf6fkRFgsWBrjjgqHGip4Vf4D0/edit)

### Chatterino Forks

There are lots of different versions of Chatterino for you to use, most of them are based upon "vanilla", or "normal", Chatterino and have useful features that the normal version doesn't have!

- [Dankerino](https://github.com/Mm2PL/dankerino) - Adds quality of life and features (or fixes) that aren't accepted into the upstream repo and keeps inline with development of the normal version.
- [Chatterino7](https://github.com/SevenTV/chatterino7) - Normal Chatterino but adds 7tv emote support, kept inline with normal Chatterino.
- [Chatterino Pronouns](https://github.com/GabeEddyT/chatterino2) - The Pronoun version of Chatterino includes support for the Twitch Chat Pronouns extension created by [Alejo47](https://pronouns.alejo.io). **NOTE:** Pronouns need to be toggled on in settings for them to show.

#### Other Chat Clients

Chatterino not working out for you? There are even more options out there.

- [Chatty](https://chatty.github.io/) - Chatty is a chat software specifically made for Twitch, in the spirit of a classic IRC Client.

## Emotes

Wondering why we're all spamming `catKISS`? Better Twitch TV is a browser extension which enables you to see them! Head on over to [betterttv.com](https://betterttv.com) to find out more about installing so `catKISS` turns into ![catKISS](https://cdn.betterttv.net/emote/6084d90339b5010444d05c16/1x). So you have BTTV installed and still can't see some emotes like `widepeepoPhilza`? You can find even more emotes on 7tv over at [7tv.app](https://7tv.app) and now you can see ![widepeepoPhilza](https://cdn.7tv.app/emote/632b49fe61c6bb90cba4af37/1x.webp) in all its wide glory.
