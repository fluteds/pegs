# Phil's Early Gang Society

Also known as "Pegs" or Early Gang. Here you will find some useful resources for offline/online chat and useful tools that can improve your Twitch experience.

If you have any questions or want something taken off (or put on) whisper me on Twitch `@fluted`. If you have a hand in using GitHub or know how to do pull requests, this site is fully open sourced!

## VODS

Looking to catch up on past streams?

- `!vods` - Chat command that sends a link to our vod sheet!
- [VOD Sheet](https://tinyurl.com/PhilzaVODList) - Community ran Google Doc that contains links, timestamps and summaries on past VODs. You can submit your own timestamps and summaries to be reviewed using the form link on the document. Made by Skyler and the Philza archive team.
- [Unofficial VODs YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbbFwA30EUO2p2U1RCnwVTA) run by Mercy (15k+ subscribers.)

## Chatterino

Want to chat more offline and online? Most of us use a handy chat client called Chatterino to chat with fellow Pegs online and offline. *Note: You cannot gain points while watching a stream just in Chatterino/Streamlink you must have the Twitch chat in a browser open.*

### Features

- Custom pings.
- Chat highlights.
- Link previews
- Inline image previews in chat.
- Chat filters, such as local sub mode.
- [Check out my filters to help you get started with them.](https://gist.github.com/fluteds/a97038a7ffa1beece30974ec8cca0291)

### Setting Up Chatterino

Chatterino can be very overwhelming to use when you first download it. Skyler made a [very useful and helpful Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/155OY6ndhY3Iy_4xo9Nf6fkRFgsWBrjjgqHGip4Vf4D0/edit) explaining all the main features of Chatterino and how to set it up to how you want it.

Link to the guide can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/155OY6ndhY3Iy_4xo9Nf6fkRFgsWBrjjgqHGip4Vf4D0/edit)

### Backing Up Settings

My small simple Batch script for Windows users to backup their Chatterino settings to Google Drive and vice versa. I made it for myself but I think others could also use this. The source code can be found and read [here!](https://github.com/fluteds/batch/blob/main/command/misc/copy-chatterino-settings.cmd) *Note: Requires Google Drive for Desktop to use this script out of the box.*

**Download**

- To download the batch file go [here.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluteds/batch/main/command/misc/copy-chatterino-settings.cmd) (GitHub)
- Save via Right Clicking and selecting `Save Page As`.

**Running**

Out of the box the script assumes your Chatterino settings are saved at `C:\Users\%username%\appdata\roaming\chatterino2\settings\` and your Chatterino Google Drive backup is saved at `G:\My Drive\Chatterino\`. If you're tech savvy you can change the location variables (`drivePath` & `chatterinoPath`) in the script with Notepad.

- Double click on the saved `bat` file.
- Accept the Windows security pop up, this file is 100% safe. [You can double check here.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file-analysis/YmU2ZjA2ZGU0OTNlYjE1Njc2Y2E0MTliOWI3ZGMxMDA6MTY2NjM1ODEwMg==)
- Follow the instructions on the terminal popup.

    <i>Note: The script when double clicked and not opened through the cmd line will automatically close after it runs without any errors. This example shows exactly what the script does without it automatically closing.</i>

### Chatterino Forks

There are lots of different versions of Chatterino for you to use, most of them are based upon the "nightly" version, kind of like a beta, which releases more often than major stable updates. Most of these forks use nightly as a foundation and have useful features that the normal stable version doesn't have.

- [Dankerino](https://github.com/Mm2PL/dankerino) - Adds quality of life and features (or fixes) that aren't accepted into the upstream repo and keeps inline with development of the nightly version. Dankerino also has 7TV badges support pulled from Chatterino7.
- [Chatterino7](https://github.com/SevenTV/chatterino7) - Chatterino but adds 7TV emote support. Kept inline with nightly Chatterino.
- [Chatterino Pronouns](https://github.com/GabeEddyT/chatterino2) - The Pronoun version of Chatterino includes support for the Twitch Chat Pronouns extension created by [Alejo47](https://pronouns.alejo.io). *Note: Pronouns need to be toggled on in settings for them to show and user pronouns are loaded for ALL users individually in ALL chats at once and is not reccomended for lower end PCs.*

#### Other Desktop Chat Clients

Chatterino not working out for you? There are even more options out there.

- [Chatty](https://chatty.github.io/) - Chatty is a chat software specifically made for Twitch, in the spirit of a classic IRC Client.

### Mobile Chatters

Want to chat on the go? These apps are useful for mobile chatters. All of the following applications are open sourced and can be sideloaded or installed using an APK. üéâ

- [Chatsen (iOS and Android)](https://chatsen.app/) - Twitch chat application for iOS and Android with support for 7TV, BTTV and FFZ. Add up to 4500 channels, although I'm not sure why you'd want to. Not many people know Chatsen also has video livestream support. *
- [Dankchat (Android Only)](https://dank.chat/) - Chat in multiple channels at once, regardless if the streamers are live or offline, with FrankerFaceZ, BTTV and 7TV emote support built-in.
- [Frosty (iOS and Android)](https://frostyapp.io/) - Meant to be an alternative to the Twitch mobile app with browsing, vod watching, 7TV, BetterTTV (BTTV), and FrankerFaceZ (FFZ) support.

**To enable subscriber perks in the livestream video viewer you will need to sign into Twitch.*
